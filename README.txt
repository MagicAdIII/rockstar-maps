Tools for making a very simple web slippy map of Grand Theft Auto V maps.
By Nelson Minar <nelson@monkey.org>

I don't want to host this map myself because of copyright concerns.
No support provided for this code, just hoping it's a useful guide for
someone to roll their own amp.

maketiles.sh runs gdal2tiles.py to slice up the source image into tiles.
map.html is a simple Leaflet / web map.

You're on your own for finding the map image source.

See this tutorial for more info on gdal2tiles.py
